`nwbview` is a software to display the contents of the binary NWB file format. It is written in Rust for high-performance, memory safety and ease of deployment.

## NWB format

[Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://www.nwb.org/) is a standard data format to represent neurophysiology data files. It enables interoperability between neurophysiology data produced by different neuroscience labs. Examples of the data stored in .NWB format range from patch clamp experiments to optical physiology experiments.

The underlying storage technology used by the NWB format is the binary [HDF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format). While storing the files as binary brings advantages on the read/write speed as well as the file size, it stores the data in a way that is not readable by humans. I.e. one cannot open the file in a text editor to see the contents, thus there is need for a viewer.

## GUI

The screenshot below shows the `nwbview` GUI. The left panel shows the contents of the NWB file in a tree structure. The right panel shows the details of the selected item, which can be a plot, a table or a text.

`nwbview` uses the [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui)  Rust GUI library for rendering.


## Public NWB Data Sources

Below are some public NWB data sources that can be displayed with `nwbview`.

* [thalamoreticular-portal](https://bbp.epfl.ch/thalamoreticular-portal)
* [nwb.org/example-datasets](https://www.nwb.org/example-datasets/)
* [channelpedia](https://channelpedia.epfl.ch/)


## To install and run using cargo

**Note:** HDF5 needs to be installed in your system as cargo will try to locate the HDF5 root directory and/or headers.

First install the `cargo` package manager and then run the following command to install `nwbview`.

```shell
cargo install nwbview
```

Once you completed the installation, simply type `nwbview` on the console to run it.

```shell
nwbview
```


## To build and run from the source code

The Rust library dependencies are provided in the `cargo.toml` file.

Note that the Rust libraries depend on the following system packages that need to be provided.

* `libgtk-3-dev`
* `librust-atk-dev`
* `libhdf5-serial-dev`

The exact names of the packages may differ between systems.

Once all the dependencies are satisfied, go to the directory containing `cargo.toml` and run the following command.

```shell
cargo run --release
```

The release flag builds the artifacts with optimizations. Do not specify it when you need to debug.
